Description
-----------
This module adds a webform content type to your Drupal site.
A webform can be a questionnaire, contact or request form. These can be used 
by visitor to make contact or to enable a more complex survey than polls
provide. Submissions from a webform are saved in a database table and 
can optionally be mailed to e-mail addresses upon submission.
